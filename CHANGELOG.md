## August 13, 2026 — v2.3.5

### Fix: Ticketmaster Seats Imported Without Prices

Ticketmaster seats were landing in the dashboard with no price. Price resolution read only `_embedded.offer`, probing a list of guessed field spellings (`totalPrice`, `faceValue`, `listPrice`, …) because the real field name had never been confirmed against a live response.

A capture of event `0700646BCF6088AD` settled it: price is carried on the facet itself as `listPriceRange`, an array of `{ currency, min, max }` in whole dollars (`371.00`), not cents. A facet groups identically-priced listings, so `min` and `max` are normally equal and we take `min`, preferring the USD entry when an event lists multiple currencies. The `_embedded.offer` probe is kept as a fallback for responses that omit `listPriceRange`.

The offer ids themselves are opaque routing handles — `GN6DCMRVGAYDOOBRGIZHYMJZHAZDCODBGQ2DK` decodes to `3|1250078122|198218a445` — so they were never going to yield a price on their own.

Stored as `dollars * 1000` to match `centsToUSD()` in the popup, which applies a `1.0` fee multiplier for the `ticketmaster` site, so listed prices render through unchanged.

**Files changed:** `extension/background.js`

### Ticketmaster Support

Added Ticketmaster as a second source alongside the FIFA resale site. A new adapter (`ticketmaster-adapter.js`) detects event pages, pulls the event id from the URL and the `c-tmpt` token from cookies, and calls the ISMDS facets endpoint. `injected.js` routes Ticketmaster scans to the adapter and posts the raw response through to the service worker, which does the parsing.

Decoding seats out of a facets response takes two passes. Seats arrive packed into a `places` string under `compress=places`, first as nested bracket groups — `A[B,C]` is `AB` and `AC`, nesting arbitrarily — and each expanded id is then unpadded RFC 4648 base32 over `<section>:<row>:<seat>`, so `GEYDAORTGE5DEMY` decodes to section 100, row 31, seat 23. Verified against a live response: every facet's expanded place count matched its reported `count`.

Two request-parameter details cost real debugging time. `embed` repeats once per value — passing an array to the `URLSearchParams` constructor stringifies it to `area,description`, which the API rejects. And `embed=offer` is what makes prices resolvable at all; without it the response still lists every seat, but each facet references only an opaque offer id.

Site discrimination runs off the hostname (`siteFromUrl`), seats are namespaced under a `ticketmaster:<eventId>` game key, and the popup gained a Ticketmaster empty state plus a `1.0` fee multiplier (its listed prices are already all-in, unlike the FIFA resale site's `1.15`).

**Files changed:** `extension/manifest.json`, `extension/ticketmaster-adapter.js`, `extension/injected.js`, `extension/content.js`, `extension/background.js`, `extension/popup.js`, `extension/popup.html`, `extension/popup.css`

---

## April 20, 2026 — v2.3.4

### Per-License Alert Pick Overrides

Added server-side per-license `maxPicks` overrides so individual users can have a higher pick limit (upon additional purchases) without affecting everyone. The override map lives in `alert_constants.ts`; adding a new entry requires an edge function redeploy. The popup now reads the server-returned `maxPicks` from the `get-alerts` response, so overridden users see the correct slot count in the UI automatically.

**Redeploy:** `supabase functions deploy save-alerts` and `supabase functions deploy get-alerts`

**Files changed:** `supabase/functions/_shared/alert_constants.ts`, `supabase/functions/save-alerts/index.ts`, `supabase/functions/get-alerts/index.ts`, `extension/popup.js`, `extension/manifest.json`

---

## April 19, 2026 — v2.3.3

### Allow Swapping Alert Game Picks + Increase to 6 Picks

Alert picks are no longer permanently locked after saving. Users can now remove a saved match and add a different one. Pick limit raised from 3 to 6. The email lock remains in place. Removed all per-pick lock enforcement from the backend (`save-alerts`) and lock UI from the frontend (lock icons, "picks are final" warning, confirmation dialog).

**Note:** Also update `max_picks` to `6` in `scan_config.json` in the public repo.

**Files changed:** `extension/popup.js`, `extension/background.js`, `supabase/functions/save-alerts/index.ts`, `supabase/functions/get-alerts/index.ts`

---

## April 19, 2026 — v2.3.2

### Fix: Insights Tab Rejecting Pro + Web Licenses

The `get-insights` Edge Function was hardcoded to verify against the Pro + Web + Alerts product ID (level 30), so Pro + Web users (level 20) passed the client-side check but got "License not valid for Insights tier" from the server. Fixed to accept any license level 20+.

### Remote Max Alerts Control

The per-user alert pick limit (`maxPicks`) is now read from `scan_config.json` in the public GitHub repo instead of being hardcoded server-side. To change the limit, edit `max_picks` in `scan_config.json` and push — no Edge Function redeploy or extension update needed. Server-side `MAX_PICKS` raised to 10 as a safety ceiling only.

**Files changed:** `supabase/functions/get-insights/index.ts`, `supabase/functions/_shared/alert_constants.ts`, `extension/popup.js`, `extension/manifest.json`

---

## April 18, 2026 — v2.3.1

### Fix: Map Zoom Triggering DataDome Block

Zooming the seatmap after a scan could trigger a duplicate full scan, causing DataDome to restrict access. Root cause: the `scannedGames` deduplication guard was an in-memory `Set` that was lost when the MV3 service worker terminated after idle (~30s). When the site's own `/seatmap/config` request fired on zoom, the restarted worker treated it as a fresh page and re-scanned.

**Fix:** Persisted `scannedGames` in `chrome.storage.session` (survives SW restarts, clears on browser close). Added defense-in-depth `scanInProgress` flag and 60-second cooldown in `injected.js` to reject duplicate scan commands at the page level. Manual rescans from the popup bypass the cooldown via a `force` flag.

**Files changed:** `extension/background.js`, `extension/injected.js`, `extension/content.js`, `extension/manifest.json`

---

## April 18, 2026 — v2.3.0

### Insights Tab — Market Insights with Two Chart Types

Replaced the "Coming Soon" placeholder with a fully functional Insights tab, powered by a Supabase materialized table (`insights_priced_to_sell`) that refreshes hourly via `pg_cron`.

**Avg "Priced to Sell" (bar chart):** Shows the average price of the cheapest 15% of listings per day over 7 days. Represents what motivated sellers are actually asking. Day-over-day percentage change displayed above each bar. Color gradient dampened so narrow price ranges don't appear misleadingly different.

**Wall Movement (heatmap):** Price distribution grid — days as columns, price ranges as rows. Cell intensity shows what percentage of that day's listings sit in each price bucket. Dark bands = price walls where sellers cluster. Bands drifting down = sellers capitulating. Dynamic bucketing collapses the top 20% (P80+) and mid-range (P50–P80) into single rows, with granular rows in the bottom 50% where walls are most visible. Royal blue color scale with adaptive text color (white on dark, gray on light).

**Filters:** Four multi-select checkbox dropdowns (game, city, team, category) with cascading logic — selecting a city narrows the available games/teams/categories, and vice versa. LMS toggle ("Include Last Minute Sales site") off by default. Knockout games show stage + matchup code in dropdown (e.g. "#73 · R32 · 2A v 2B").

**Info button:** (i) next to "Market Insights" toggles an explanation panel describing the current chart type and noting data is crowdsourced from the community.

**"Current" column:** Rightmost column labeled "Current / Earlier Today" shows data from today's scans, refreshed hourly.

**License gating:** Insights requires Pro + Web tier (level 20), lowered from Pro + Web + Alerts (30). Locked state shows faded preview screenshot background with license key input form — users can activate without switching to the Scanner tab. Same license input added to Alerts locked state.

**Scan-ago timer:** Small "7 mins ago" label under the SCANNED badge, persisted in `chrome.storage.local` so it survives popup close/reopen. Updates every 60 seconds.

**SQL architecture:** Two-phase refresh function — Phase 1 computes bottom-15% avg per (match, day, category), Phase 2 backfills price histograms ($50 buckets) from all seats. Uses `ROW_NUMBER()` top-5 scans per day with downstream NULL-price filtering (avoids expensive EXISTS checks). Staging table swap for zero-downtime refreshes. JOINs `match_schedule` for proper game info and `category_xref` for normalized category names (Cat 1–4, Accessible, Other).

**Edge function (`get-insights`):** Paginated fetch (1000-row batches) to bypass Supabase `max_rows` cap. Pro + Web license verification via Gumroad API.

**Files changed:** `extension/popup.js`, `extension/popup.css`, `extension/popup.html`, `extension/background.js`, `supabase/functions/get-insights/index.ts`
**Files added:** `extension/images/insights-preview.png`, `extension/images/alerts-preview.png`
**Local-only (not in repo):** `supabase/migrate_insights.sql`, `supabase/seed_category_xref.sql`

## April 17, 2026

### Remote Scan Config — DB-Controlled Timing Profiles

Scan timing constants (jitter delays, retry cooldowns, consecutive-block thresholds, speed profiles) are no longer hardcoded in `injected.js`. They now live in a `scan_config` Supabase table and are fetched on extension startup + every 60 minutes via `chrome.alarms`. The extension falls back to hardcoded defaults if the fetch fails (offline resilience).

Also corrected the speed profile ordering — "cautious" was previously faster than "balanced" (500-900ms vs 900-1500ms). New corrected values: aggressive (0-0ms), balanced (600-1000ms), cautious (1200-1800ms), stealth (1300-2700ms).

To tune live: `UPDATE scan_config SET profiles = jsonb_set(profiles, '{balanced}', '{"min":500,"max":800}') WHERE id = 1;` via Supabase SQL editor. No extension update needed.

**Files changed:** `extension/background.js`, `extension/content.js`, `extension/injected.js`, `supabase/schema.sql`
**Files added:** `supabase/migrate_scan_config.sql`

### LMS (Last Minute Sales) Site Support — v2.2.0

Added full support for FIFA's Last Minute Sales site (`fwc26-shop-usd.tickets.fifa.com`), where FIFA drops face-value tickets. The extension now works on both the resale and LMS sites with the same scan, display, and sync pipeline.

**How it works:** Site is derived from the hostname (`-shop-` = LMS, `-resale-` = resale) when API responses arrive in `background.js`. All game storage uses a compound `site:performanceId` key so LMS and resale data for the same match coexist without collision. LMS and resale share the same `performanceId` for a given match, so compound keys are mandatory.

**Pricing:** Resale seats carry per-seat `amount` (formula: `÷1000 × 1.15`). LMS seats get their price from `seatBasedPriceAmount` (premium/front-row overrides) or from the category-level pricing in the availability endpoint (formula: `÷1000`, no markup — face value). `saveAvailability` backfills any seats that arrived before category data was available.

**Popup:** Site badge (green "LMS" / purple "Resale") next to match name. `centsToUSD` is site-aware (1.15× resale, 1.0× LMS). Empty state shows buttons for both sites. Histogram shows full distribution for LMS (no top-20% tail cutoff) with single-price categories rendered as one bar flanked by empty buckets. Sort tiebreaker added: block → row → seat when prices are equal. CSV export includes `Site` in metadata.

**Database:** `site` column added to `scan_snapshots`, `seats`, `match_summary`, `match_summary_history`. Primary keys on `seats` and `match_summary` changed to compound `(site, performance_id, ...)`. Migration file: `supabase/migrate_add_site.sql`. Existing rows defaulted to `'resale'`.

**Ingest:** `ingest-scan` accepts `site` in payload, scopes all deletes and stats recomputes by `(site, performance_id)`. Zero-seat LMS scans log a snapshot row with `seat_count=0`. Suspicious price distribution check skipped for LMS (face-value tickets legitimately share prices).

**Alerts:** Site-agnostic by design. `alert_configs` stores `performance_id` + threshold with no site field — the future dispatcher queries by `performance_id` without site filter, covering both sites.

**Startup migration:** On service worker boot, legacy bare-perfId game keys are rewritten to `resale:perfId` with `site='resale'` stamped.

**Files changed:** `extension/background.js`, `extension/popup.js`, `extension/popup.html`, `extension/popup.css`, `supabase/schema.sql`, `supabase/functions/ingest-scan/index.ts`
**Files added:** `supabase/migrate_add_site.sql`

### Alerts Fix: Per-Pick Locking + Centralized MAX_PICKS + 180-Day TTL — 2:30 AM ET
Fixed the "saved 1 pick, can't add the other 2" bug reported by a Pro + Web + Alerts user. The original lock was per-config (`games_locked` flag at the whole-form level), so saving with any count N < 3 hid the match browser entirely and there was no way to top off the remaining slots. Lock is now **per-pick**: saved matches remain permanent individually (lock icon + threshold-only edit drawer), but the browse section and empty pick slots stay visible whenever total picks < `MAX_PICKS`. New picks added in a later session trigger the same confirm dialog as the original first save and lock once committed. Server-side enforcement added in `save-alerts`: fetches the existing games array on update, rejects any request that drops a locked match or swaps its `performance_id`. Unsaved picks in the current session can still be freely removed via the drawer's "Remove pick" button, which only renders for unlocked picks.

Also centralized the `MAX_PICKS = 3` constant into a new `supabase/functions/_shared/alert_constants.ts` module, imported by both `save-alerts` and `get-alerts`. Both Edge Functions return it as `maxPicks` in their JSON response; the popup reads from there and drives every former literal `3` off it (slot iteration, counter, subtitle, browser visibility check, add-button guard). Changing the per-user pick limit is now one constant edit + `supabase functions deploy` for both functions — the popup auto-syncs on next `loadSavedAlertConfig()` call with zero client rebuild.

Added an `expires_at` column to `alert_configs` with a 180-day SQL default. Set on insert via the column default, never touched on update — adding picks later does not roll the TTL forward. Returned as `expiresAt` (ms epoch) from `get-alerts` for future UI use; popup ignores it for now. Live migration + backfill for existing rows (`expires_at = created_at + interval '180 days'`) ran by hand in the Supabase SQL Editor.

**Files changed:** `extension/popup.js`, `supabase/functions/save-alerts/index.ts`, `supabase/functions/get-alerts/index.ts`, `supabase/schema.sql`
**Files added:** `supabase/functions/_shared/alert_constants.ts`

### Clarify Scan State in Popup: Stuck-Help + SCANNING/SCANNED Badge — 1:10 AM ET
Two honesty fixes on the Scanner tab. First: a new "Stuck here?" help block appears on the Scanning empty state, pointing users at the BUY TICKETS → BUY → game workaround for when the seat map page doesn't kick off the API calls the extension needs to start a scan. Subtle purple accent panel under the existing hint, only visible in the Scanning variant of the empty state. Second: the header badge no longer says "LIVE" with a 1.5s pulsing green dot (which falsely implied continuous real-time monitoring). It now flips between **SCANNING** during an active scan and **SCANNED** once the scan status hits `done` or progress reaches 100%, with a static green dot — no animation. State transition reads cleanly: empty-state "Scanning…" → dashboard "SCANNING" badge → "SCANNED" on the final tile. No timer drift, no stale "LIVE" claims while the user is staring at a several-hours-old snapshot.

**Files changed:** `extension/popup.html`, `extension/popup.css`, `extension/popup.js`

### Capture Extra Seat Fields for Preselect Bridge — 1:05 AM ET
Three more fields added to the per-seat object captured in `background.js` `saveSeats`: `contingentId`, `seatQuality`, and `extent` (the seat polygon's bounding box `[minX, minY, maxX, maxY]`, computed by a new `bboxOf()` helper that walks any nested coordinate array — Point, Polygon, or MultiPolygon). These are the fields the FIFA SPA needs to render a "selected" state when the seat-preselect bridge eventually writes entries into sessionStorage. All three flow through to `scan_snapshots.seats_data` JSONB automatically — no DB schema change, no `ingest-scan` change. The bridge itself remains paused on the blocker of not knowing the live SPA's sessionStorage key yet; this change just gets the data flowing so when the bridge is unblocked, real scan data is already populated in the cloud for testing and field-diffing against hand-picked entries.

**Files changed:** `extension/background.js`

### Salvage Scans on Per-Seat Anomalies — 1:00 AM ET
Fixed a bug where the `ingest-scan` Edge Function would reject an entire scan (HTTP 400) if any single seat had an out-of-range price, bad `seatId`, or oversized string field. Root cause: the per-seat validation loop at [`index.ts:63-88`](supabase/functions/ingest-scan/index.ts#L63-L88) returned on the first failure instead of skipping the bad seat. New behavior: clamp prices above the Postgres int4 max to `2147483647`, null out sub-$1 or non-numeric prices (the `seats.price` column is already nullable), truncate oversized string fields to 100 chars, and drop seats with bad IDs (primary key — nothing to recover). `MIN_SEAT_COUNT` lowered from 10 to 1 so sold-out matches with only a handful of resale seats still ingest. `MAX_SEAT_COUNT` raised from 15,000 to 50,000 **and** changed from hard-reject to soft-trim — runaway payloads get sliced to the cap with a server-side `console.log` instead of bouncing the whole scan. Top-level structural checks (visitorId format, performanceId format, match name, 50%-same-price anomaly guard) still reject on fail, because those genuinely indicate a broken scan.

Originally diagnosed when David's and his brother-in-law's scans were silently not landing in `scan_snapshots` while everyone else's were. Walked the DevTools service-worker Network tab → saw a 400 on the POST → response body named `"Seat price out of range"` → root caused to a single VIP-tier seat exceeding the previous `MAX_PRICE_MILLICENTS = 100_000_000` (~$100k) cap, which rejected the entire ~10k seat payload. The new cap is the Postgres `int4` column ceiling, not an arbitrary anti-abuse number.

**Files changed:** `supabase/functions/ingest-scan/index.ts`

## April 13, 2026

### Cloud Restore for Alerts + "Picks Are Final" Warning — 1:00 AM ET
Added a `get-alerts` Edge Function so the extension can rehydrate the Alerts tab from Supabase whenever the local cache is missing or stale. Previously, if `chrome.storage.local.alertConfigs` was lost (extension reinstall, new browser, new machine, profile switch, Chrome Sync reset, or — until earlier today — a Clear & Rescan click), the Alerts tab would show as empty even though the dispatcher was still firing emails to the user from the server-side `alert_configs` row. Worse, re-saving with a different email would hit the email-lock 403 with no way for the user to recover. Now: every Alerts tab open does a cloud fetch first using the user's license key, falls back to local cache only on network/server failure, and shows a small "⚠ Offline — cached picks" chip in the header when running offline. Server is always the source of truth on conflict; local cache is purely an offline fallback. New `FETCH_ALERTS` message type in the background service worker, mirroring the existing `SAVE_ALERTS` structure (license verify → hash → service-role read on `alert_configs`).

Also added a prominent orange warning banner at the top of the Alerts tab (before first save only) reminding users that match picks are final after saving — only price thresholds can change later. Disappears once `gamesLocked` becomes true so it doesn't nag users who already committed.

**Files changed:** `extension/background.js`, `extension/popup.js`, `extension/popup.css`, `CHANGELOG.md`
**Files added:** `supabase/functions/get-alerts/index.ts`

### Fix: Clear & Rescan No Longer Wipes Alerts — 12:00 AM ET
The "Clear & Rescan" and "Clear Data" buttons on the Scanner tab were silently destroying the user's saved Alerts tab picks (matches, thresholds, category, seats) as a side effect. Root cause: the `CLEAR_DATA` background handler used `chrome.storage.local.clear()` and manually rescued only the `license` key, so any other top-level key (including `alertConfigs` and `visitorId`) got nuked. Replaced the clear-then-restore dance with a surgical `chrome.storage.local.remove("games")` — only the captured scan data is removed, everything else (Alerts picks, license, visitor ID, scan speed preference, filter state) is untouched. Forward-compatible: any future storage key automatically survives by default. Also fixes a silent secondary bug where `visitorId` (the anonymous Supabase attribution key) was being regenerated on every Clear & Rescan, inflating "unique scanners" stats and breaking per-user scan history correlation on the backend.

**Files changed:** `background.js`

## April 12, 2026

### Alerts Tab — Pro + Web + Alerts Tier — 10:00 PM ET
Added a third tab to the popup ("Alerts") for Pro + Web + Alerts ($49.99) users. Pick up to 3 World Cup matches, set a price threshold per match (3 modes: % of face value, $ offset from face, or absolute $), choose a category filter (Any / CAT 1 / CAT 2 / CAT 3) and number of seats needed. Picks are saved to Supabase via a new `save-alerts` Edge Function that verifies the Gumroad license server-side and locks the user's email + chosen matches. Threshold drawer features a custom range slider with a green "deal zone" (gradient fill that follows the thumb) and a live example that updates in real time as the user drags. Free / lower-tier users see an upgrade prompt instead of the picker. Match list is searchable + filterable by stage and country. Locked picks show as read-only after first save; only thresholds can be adjusted.

**Files changed:** `popup.js`, `popup.css`, `popup.html`, `background.js`
**Files added:** `supabase/functions/save-alerts/index.ts`

### Threshold Slider — 3-Mode Price Targeting — 9:00 PM ET
Replaced the original "Below face / Custom $" segmented control in the Alerts threshold drawer with a slider supporting three modes:
- **% vs Face** (default): -50% to +300%, snaps to 5% steps
- **$ vs Face**: -$500 to +$3000, snaps to $100 steps
- **Absolute $**: $0 to $5000, snaps to $50 steps

Slider track has a green fill that tracks the thumb, current value displayed above as a label (`+10%` / `Face` / `+$250` / `$550`), and a live example sentence using a fixed $500 reference face value for easy mental math (e.g. "If face value is $500, at +20%, you'll be alerted when the price drops at or below $600."). The Absolute mode is honest: "Ignore face value, you'll be alerted when the price drops at or below $X." Pick summary line shows the user's intent compactly: `≤+10% vFace · Any · 2tix` instead of just dollars. Threshold dollar value resolved at save time using the actual face value from the `face_values` table.

**Files changed:** `popup.js`, `popup.css`

### `alerts_sent` Audit Table + Dispatcher Dedup Hooks — 8:30 PM ET
Added an `alerts_sent` table to track every email the (forthcoming) dispatcher fires. Each row captures `license_hash`, `email`, `match_number`, `performance_id`, `threshold`, `fired_price`, `category`, and `fired_at`. Indexed on `(license_hash, match_number, fired_at DESC)` for fast dedup lookups. RLS locks it down to service-role only. Used by the dispatcher to enforce: 24-hour cooldown per `(license, match)` pair, with a re-fire allowed if the new price is at least 10% lower than the last fired price (meaningful re-drop only).

**Files changed:** `supabase/schema.sql`

### `alert_configs_history` Audit Log — 8:00 PM ET
Added an `alert_configs_history` table that captures every save against `alert_configs` (insert or update) as an immutable row. Lets us see how a user's picks evolve over time without rewriting the live `alert_configs` row. The `save-alerts` Edge Function appends to history on every successful save (best-effort — failure here doesn't fail the user's save). Indexed on `(license_hash, saved_at DESC)` and `(saved_at DESC)`. RLS service-role only.

**Files changed:** `supabase/schema.sql`, `supabase/functions/save-alerts/index.ts`

### Seat Preselect Bridge Scaffolding (Inactive — Future Feature) — 7:30 PM ET
Added the client-side scaffolding for an "email link → preselected seats" feature: when the dispatcher's alert email link includes `?fts_seats=A,B`, the extension's `content.js` content script parses the param, looks up rich seat metadata from `chrome.storage.local`, and writes to the FIFA seat picker's sessionStorage so the picker boots with those seats already highlighted. `background.js` now captures additional FIFA seat fields (`blockId`, `areaId`, `tariffId`, `advantageId`, `movementId`) per scan to support this. **Currently inactive** — the storage shape needs to be reverse-engineered against the live FIFA SPA (the legacy Secutix shape this was built against has been replaced by a newer frontend); the bridge writes to a key the SPA doesn't read, which is a silent no-op. No user-facing impact until the bridge is rewritten and the dispatcher starts emitting `?fts_seats=` URLs.

**Files changed:** `background.js`, `content.js`

### Supabase Composite Indexes + Match Schedule Performance IDs — 6:00 PM ET
Added composite indexes to `scan_snapshots` for the most common query patterns: `(performance_id, scanned_at DESC)` and `(visitor_id, scanned_at DESC)`. Backfilled `performance_id` into the `match_schedule` table so dispatcher and webapp can resolve match → performance_id without a join through `match_summary`.

**Files changed:** `supabase/schema.sql`, `supabase/seed_match_schedule.sql`

### Seats Table Reflects Current Availability — 5:00 PM ET
Changed `ingest-scan` from upsert-by-seat-id to delete-then-insert per match. Old behavior left stale rows in `seats` for seats that had since been bought — every scan would silently grow the table. Now each scan deletes all rows for that `performance_id` first and inserts the fresh set, so `seats` always reflects the current availability snapshot from the most recent scanner. `first_seen_at` is set to the same timestamp as `last_seen_at` since we no longer track historical first-sightings (use `scan_snapshots` for that).

**Files changed:** `supabase/functions/ingest-scan/index.ts`

### Match Schedule Seed (Full Country Names) — 4:00 PM ET
Added `supabase/seed_match_schedule.sql` containing all 104 World Cup 2026 matches with date, stage, city, home/away teams (full English country names like "United States" not "USA"), and `matchup` fallback for TBD knockout fixtures. Public read RLS for the extension's anon key.

**Files added:** `supabase/seed_match_schedule.sql`

### Face Values Seed — 3:00 PM ET
Added `supabase/seed_face_values.sql` with FIFA's official face value per category (CAT 1/2/3) for all 104 World Cup 2026 matches, taken from the December 11, 2025 randomized drawing. Public read RLS so the extension and dispatcher can resolve `(match_number, category) → face_value` without needing a service-role key.

**Files added:** `supabase/seed_face_values.sql`

### Version Update Checker + Footer Link — 2:00 PM ET
Extension now checks GitHub for the latest version (via raw `manifest.json`) on popup open, debounced to once every 6 hours via `chrome.alarms`. Shows a banner at the top of the popup if a newer version is available, with a one-click link to the Chrome Web Store listing. Added a `fifaticketscout.com` link to the popup footer alongside Buy Me a Coffee and the Etsy shop. Bumped extension version to **2.1.0**.

**Files changed:** `popup.js`, `popup.html`, `popup.css`, `background.js`, `manifest.json`

## April 11, 2026

### Supabase Data Sync — 5:30 PM ET
Every completed scan now syncs seat data to Supabase. All users (free and Pro) contribute crowdsourced data. Each install gets an anonymous visitor ID. Scan history is preserved as full snapshots for future price trend analysis. Match summaries are aggregated per match with hourly snapshots for trend charts. Sync is fire-and-forget — never blocks scanning, silently fails if backend is unreachable.

**Files changed:** `background.js`, `manifest.json`
**Files added:** `supabase/schema.sql`, `supabase/functions/ingest-scan/index.ts`

### Pro Tier & License Key System — 12:00 AM ET
Added Gumroad-based license key verification with a numeric tier system (level 0/10/20/30). Free users get Balanced scan speed and single-game storage. Pro users (level 10+) unlock Stealth, Cautious, and Aggressive scan speeds plus multi-tab support. License section in the popup with activation/deactivation UI. Re-verifies license every 24 hours via `chrome.alarms`. Extension works identically if Gumroad is unreachable (cached license). License provider is modular — one function to swap if we change payment providers.

**Files changed:** `background.js`, `popup.js`, `popup.html`, `popup.css`, `manifest.json`

### Retry Blocked Tiles — 6:31 PM ET
When a tile gets blocked by bot detection (403), it's now retried after a 3-second cooldown instead of being permanently skipped. Blocked tiles are collected during the first pass, then retried as a batch. If still blocked, the scan completes with partial data instead of failing entirely.

**Files changed:** `injected.js`

### Clear Seats on Tab Re-navigate — 5:45 PM ET
When navigating back to a previously scanned game on the same tab, old seat data is now cleared before the fresh scan starts. Also clears scanned state on page refresh via `chrome.tabs.onUpdated` so auto-scan always fires on reload.

**Files changed:** `background.js`

### Resilient 403 Handling — 4:30 PM ET
Intermittent 403 blocks from DataDome are now skipped instead of aborting the entire scan. Only aborts after 3 consecutive blocks. Removed exponential backoff on 403s. Broadened CAPTCHA detection to catch any non-JSON 403/429 response.

**Files changed:** `injected.js`

### 10k Tile Grid (Mimics Site Pattern) — 3:00 PM ET
Switched from a variable-size tile grid (20k/50k) to a fixed 4×4 grid of 10k×10k tiles covering 0-40k coordinate space. This matches the tile sizes and alignment the FIFA site's own client uses when a user clicks through blocks. Speed profiles now only control delay between tiles (16 tiles for all speeds). Significantly reduces bot detection triggers.

**Files changed:** `injected.js`

### Multi-Tab Support — 2:00 PM ET
Multiple games can now be open in different tabs simultaneously. The popup auto-detects which game to show based on the active tab's URL. Scans route to the correct tab via `tabId` tracking. No more game data being wiped when switching between matches. Tab cleanup on close.

**Files changed:** `background.js`, `popup.js`

### Scan Speed UI — 12:00 PM ET
Added scan speed selector (Stealth, Cautious, Balanced, Aggressive) in the match header with emoji buttons. Pill progress indicator shows scan percentage and elapsed time. Speed selection persists across popup open/close. Match info caching prevents UI flicker during scan updates.

**Files changed:** `popup.js`, `popup.html`, `popup.css`, `background.js`, `content.js`, `injected.js`

### $NaN Price Fix — 11:00 AM ET
Seats with null/undefined prices are now filtered out of the dashboard and CSV export. Prevents "$NaN" from appearing in the stats bar.

**Files changed:** `popup.js`

### Etsy Shop Links — 9:18 AM ET
Added links to My Son's Etsy Shop (fidgetforge6.etsy.com) in two places: replaced the refresh button in the header with an Etsy "E" icon (orange hover, tooltip "My Son's Etsy Shop"), and replaced the GitHub footer link with an Etsy footer link.

**Files changed:** `popup.html`, `popup.css`, `popup.js`

### Filter Out In-Cart Seats — 9:15 AM ET
Seats with `exclusive=false` (likely locked in another user's cart but not yet purchased) are now excluded from the dashboard and CSV export. These seats appear in the API data but aren't actually available to buy, so showing them was misleading.

**Files changed:** `popup.js`

### Fix Clear & Rescan Not Recapturing Data — 11:27 AM ET
Fixed bug where refreshing the page after Clear & Rescan wouldn't recapture seat data. Root cause: the `scannedGames` Set in the background service worker wasn't cleared when storage was wiped, so `autoScan` thought it had already scanned. Now sends `CLEAR_DATA` message to the background to reset both storage and in-memory state.

**Files changed:** `background.js`, `popup.js`

### Clear & Rescan Button — 11:09 AM ET
Renamed "Scan All Sections" to "Clear & Rescan". Clicking it now clears all captured data and prompts the user to refresh their browser to repull fresh data. Simpler and more predictable than the previous background scan approach.

**Files changed:** `popup.js`, `popup.html`

### Clear Seats Before Scan — 8:12 PM ET (Apr 4)
When a scan is triggered, existing seats for the game are now cleared first so the results are a fresh snapshot rather than accumulating stale data.

**Files changed:** `background.js`

### Persist Filter State — 5:45 PM ET
Category tab and seats-together selections now persist when the popup is closed and reopened. Previously all filters reset to defaults every time. Uses `chrome.storage.local` to save and restore state.

**Files changed:** `popup.js`

### Context-Aware Empty States — 5:30 PM ET
The popup now detects whether you're on the FIFA site, a seat map, or elsewhere, and shows contextual guidance instead of a generic "No data captured yet" message. Includes an "Open FIFA Resale Site" button when off-site. Removed redundant refresh button. Larger, cleaner logo in empty state. Added `tabs` permission.

**Files changed:** `popup.js`, `popup.html`, `popup.css`, `manifest.json`

### "Seats Together" Multi-Select Toggle — 5:02 PM ET
Redesigned the seats-together filter from single-select "N+" buttons to multi-select toggle buttons (`1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6+`). All sizes are ON by default. Users toggle OFF sizes they don't want — for example, turning off "1" hides single seats. Multiple selections are supported (e.g. only "2" and "3" active). "6+" covers clusters of 6–8 consecutive seats. Toggling all off resets to all ON. Stats, histogram, and Best Deals all update to reflect the filter.

**Files changed:** `popup.js`

### Scan Reliability: Jitter, Backoff & ETA — 4:39 PM ET
Merged scan improvements: randomized delay between requests (200–700ms jitter), exponential backoff on failures (2s → 15s cap), and estimated time remaining in the progress bar (e.g. "42% · ~12s left").

**Files changed:** `injected.js`, `popup.js`, `background.js`, `content.js`

### "Seats Together" Filter — 12:49 PM ET
Added toggle buttons for filtering seat clusters by group size. Filter acts as a primary control — stats, histogram, and Best Deals all update to reflect the selected group sizes. Shows a seat count badge when filtering is active.

**Files changed:** `popup.js`, `popup.css`

### Fix Host Permission Wildcard — 8:01 AM ET
Fixed an invalid wildcard pattern in `manifest.json`. Changed host permissions to use the correct `*.tickets.fifa.com` glob pattern, resolving extension load errors on some Chrome versions.

**Files changed:** `manifest.json`

### Support All FIFA Resale Currency Subdomains — 7:52 AM ET
Updated `manifest.json` host permissions and content script matches to work across all FIFA resale subdomains (e.g. `fwc26-resale-usd.tickets.fifa.com`, `fwc26-resale-cad.tickets.fifa.com`, `fwc26-resale-eur.tickets.fifa.com`, etc.) instead of only the USD subdomain.

**Files changed:** `manifest.json`
