# FIFA Ticket Scout

A Chrome extension that tracks real-time seat prices for FIFA World Cup 2026 tickets. Works on both the official resale site and the Last Minute Sales (LMS) face-value site. See every available seat, price distribution, and best deals — plus crowdsourced market insights across all users.

## Features

### Scanner Tab
- **Live seat capture** — Automatically intercepts seat data as you browse the FIFA resale or LMS ticket site
- **Auto-scan** — Scans all map sections when you open a match (4x4 grid of 10k tiles)
- **Scan speed control** — Stealth, Cautious, Balanced, or Aggressive speeds with remote-configurable timing profiles
- **Multi-tab support** — Open multiple matches in different tabs, each tracked independently
- **Multi-site support** — Works on both resale (`fwc26-resale-*.tickets.fifa.com`) and Last Minute Sales (`fwc26-shop-*.tickets.fifa.com`)
- **Price dashboard** — Total seats, cheapest/most expensive prices, category breakdowns with histograms
- **Best deals finder** — Groups consecutive same-price seats, ranked by value
- **Seats together filter** — Filter by group size (1–6+) to find consecutive seats
- **Block-by-block view** — Collapsible table showing seat count and min/max per block
- **CSV export** — Export all seat data with match details and timestamps
- **Resilient scanning** — Handles bot detection (403s) gracefully with retry cooldowns
- **Scan-ago timer** — Shows how long ago the last scan completed

### Insights Tab
- **Avg "Priced to Sell"** — Bar chart showing the average of the cheapest 15% of listings each day over 7 days, with day-over-day % change
- **Wall Movement heatmap** — Price distribution grid showing where sellers cluster by price over time. Dark bands = price walls. Bands drifting down = sellers capitulating
- **Multi-select filters** — Filter by game, city, team, or category with cascading logic
- **LMS toggle** — Include Last Minute Sales data alongside resale
- **All 104 matches** — Group stage shows team names, knockout shows stage + matchup codes
- **"Current" column** — Today's data refreshed hourly
- **Info button** — Explains what each chart means

### Alerts Tab
- **Price drop alerts** — Pick up to 3 games, set a price threshold, get emailed when prices drop below your target
- **Per-pick locking** — Saved picks are permanent, but you can add more until you hit the limit
- **Face value comparison** — See how current prices compare to face value

## How It Works

### Data Pipeline

1. **`injected.js`** runs in the page's MAIN world, patches `fetch`/`XMLHttpRequest` to intercept seat data. Handles full-scan by tiling the seat map into a 4x4 grid with configurable scan speeds and jittered delays.

2. **`content.js`** bridges page context and extension messaging.

3. **`background.js`** processes API data, deduplicates seats, stores in `chrome.storage.local`. Handles license verification, multi-tab tracking, and syncs scan data to Supabase (fire-and-forget).

4. **`popup.js` + `popup.html`** render three tabs: Scanner (dashboard), Insights (charts), Alerts (price drop config).

### Crowdsourced Data

Every completed scan is anonymously submitted to Supabase. A materialized table (`insights_priced_to_sell`) refreshes hourly via `pg_cron`, computing per-match pricing metrics and price distribution histograms. The Insights tab reads this data through an Edge Function.

Scan timing profiles (jitter, cooldowns, speed presets) are fetched from a remote config on startup and every 60 minutes, allowing live tuning without extension updates.

Displayed resale prices include the platform's 15% service fee. LMS prices are face value.
